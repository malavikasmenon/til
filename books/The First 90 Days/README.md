# Chapter 1: Prepare Yourself

- When starting a new role, make sure to prepare in advance about what the role requires. Many people start on the false premise that what worked so far would continue to work, which might not be true at all. The job you were doing and the new job may have different expectations and requirements and these skills may not translate well. So prepping well is key to managing the expectations.

- Few noticeable changes when going to a more senior role is, there's more ambiguity, complexity and a wider view of the company goals. You may not get filtered info like before and you have to make decisions based on data for certain ambiguities. 

- But in the case of moving to a different company, you have been hired for the skills you exhibited in the past. However, the challenge lies in applying these skills in a new environment, where you don't know much about the org culture & politics. So few onboarding checks are
    - Business orientation checklist early on to know more abt the business 
    - Stakeholder connection - Connect with direct reports, boss etc early on. Also focus on lateral relationships, ie with your peers
    - Expectations alignment - Check expectations match once you join, often times you may not know the expectations fully before joining
    - Cultural adaptation - how are decisions made, who are rewarded, understand it

- Dont just focus on your strengths alone, make sure your weak muscles dont atrophy. 

- Identify your potential blind spots - eg technical, political, cultural. You may tend to naturally prefer solving problems in one of these and avoid the others.Work on improving your blind spots

- It's natural for leaders to initially feel that they don't know a lot, and this may cause nervousness. You might end up sticking to problems you know best and end up ignoring other areas. Make sure you get out of your comfort zone and learn more

- If you feel you have potential blindspots in an area, actively reach out to peers, mentors in these areas and help learn better. 

# Chapter 2: Accelarate Your Learning
- First 30 days focus should be on learning
- Create a learning agenda - what do you want to learn and a learning plan - how are you going to learn about it
- Identify key sources of insights both inside and outside the org - eg bosses, direct reports, customers, vendors etc
- Ask questions about past, present, future. Why is something the way it is, what factors led to it, what are threats/opportunities in the future, what are we doing right etc
- Ask same questions to a set of people, to avoid getting influenced by any 1 person alone, this way you have wide range of answers for same questions that you can compare and come to your own conclusion.
- Dont fall into the trap of just taking actions, without learning and listening.
- Make a list of questions about what you want to learn before starting on the role itself. 

# Chapter 3: Match Strategy to Situation
- Identify what's the current situation that you are expected to lead, it could be any of the following
- STARS
    - Startup - Need to build things up from scratch
    - Turnaround - Essentially put out fires and change the direction of a company that's currently in trouble
    - Accelerated growth - Company that's scaling, where processes/infra needs to be set up to allow scaling
    - Realignment - Certain trends are concerning, need to realign the direction of the company to ensure future growth. Not as severe a situation as turnaround
    - Sustained success - keep the current success going, make sure people are not complacent, find ways for organisational and personal growth
- Often everything in the company may not fit perfectly with a situation, some units may be in a startup stage, some units in a sustained success stage etc. So analyse, identify the stage before commiting to a strategy. 
- Different situations require a different kind of leader, while turnaround may need a heroic style, realignment may need more of a steward. So assessing yourself as a leader, what style you generally tend to keep and introspecting what is required for the situation is crucial. 

# Chapter 4: Negotiate Success
- Clarify what are the expectations on you and how would your success be measured.
- Meet with your boss regularly, discuss problems and how to address them, and don't just give a rundown of everything you've done.
- It's on you to make the relationship work, adapt to your boss's style of doing things.
- Underpromise and overdeliver

- Ideally you need to have 5 different conversations with your boss early on
    - Situational diagonsis - both you and your boss should align on situational assessment and where in STARS your problems lie
    - Expectation - what all are you expected to accomplish short term and medium term
    - Resources - what resources can you use
    - Style - How to work together properly, what intervals to communicate at, when to consult with boss etc
    - Personal development - what are you doing right, where can you improve etc


# Chapter 5: Secure Early wins
- When securing early wins, make sure these wins are also foundation for your long term goals that you have agreed upon with your bosses
- It might be tempting to fix all low hanging fruits, but make sure that these set you up for success long term too. ie make sure these are focused and not just random tasks
- Culture is often quite important to set you up for success

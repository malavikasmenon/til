# What is this repository for?

I came across the repo https://github.com/pdubroy/til/tree/main and was inspired to create something similar. For a long time, all of my notes from learnning have been scrambled across various mediums - some in physical notebooks, some in local.txt files, some on Notion, well you get the gist. So, with this repo I hope to centralise all of it. 

Also, I have been wanting to be consistent & I'm going to try and use this to hold myself accountable. Everyday, learn something, note down what you learnt, doesn't matter if its just a heading and 5 words, note it down anyway and push it. In a few weeks, I should be able to see a pattern and understand my consistency better.
